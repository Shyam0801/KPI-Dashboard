## Technical Overview

### DAX Measures
- Created measures for Total Sales Actual, Total Sales Targets, Variance, and Variance Percentage.
- Used complex calculations to generate Year-To-Date (YTD) figures (made use of the new card visual by adding this measure as a Reference Label) and the title for trends chart.

### Interactive Visuals
- Implemented dynamic bar charts and sparklines to visualize sales performance over 14 months.
- Included conditional formatting to highlight variance percentages and target achievements.

### Filters and Segmentation
- Added filters to allow drill-down by sales teams and individual salespersons.
- Segmented data by monthly performance to provide granular insights.

## Data Insights

### Sales Performance
- Over the past 14 months, sales targets were met only in 2 months, indicating a need for strategic improvement.
- Total Sales Actual amounted to $18.95M against a target of $19.32M, resulting in a variance of -$366.86K.

### Team Analysis
- The Yummies team showed strong performance, meeting targets in 7 out of 14 months.
- Variance percentages and trend lines provided for individual salespersons reveal areas needing attention and those performing well.

### Monthly Trends
- Monthly analysis shows fluctuations in sales achievements, with significant variances in certain months.
- This trend analysis helps in identifying patterns and potential causes for underperformance.
